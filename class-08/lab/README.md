# Assignment Overview: Lab 8

Read the document, in it's entirety, before beginning your lab.

## Problem Domain

[Pat's Salmon Cookies](https://codefellows.github.io/code-201-guide/curriculum/class-06/lab/){:target="_blank"} problem domain can be found here!

## Instructions

Today you will be adding a form to your existing cookie stand project so that you can add new locations to the table by simply inputting their information with the form.

- Create a new HTML form to accept the information for a new cookie stand. Be sure to utulize the `<fieldset>` tag to help you style it.  

- Upon sumbission of the HTML form, create an event handler that creates a new instance of a cookie stand that appends to the table upon form submission. 

- Use the constructor function as your guide to determine what input fields your form needs (hint: also consider what is passed in when creating instances!).

- If not complete from lab 7, write a stand-alone function to generate a footer row which will display the total number of cookies sold per hour for all locations. When a new store is added using your form, the totals in the footer row should update to include these new sales numbers.

- Anywhere you have repeated chunks of code, apply some DRY principles. Generally, once some chunk of code is appearing for a 3rd time or so, that's when you want to consider refactoring.

- Validate your html through [HTML5 validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/Form_validation).

- Confirm that your code is following the single responsibility rule. Each function should only do one thing, with the capability to break it out further as needed.
