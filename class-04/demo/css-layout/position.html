  <h1>Position</h1>
</br>
  <h2>1. Static</h2>
  <div class="static">I am static and I am default. I am often referred to as "not positioned"</div>
</br>
  <h2>2. Relative</h2>
  <div class="relative1">I am relative to my normal position in the flow. I act just like Static unless you give me some additional TRouBLe properties, like Top, Right, Bottom, Left</div>
  <div class="relative2">If you decide to give me TRBL, I'll start looking like this!</div>
</br>
  <h2>3. Fixed - Look to the bottom right corner!</h2>
  <div class="fixed">Oh heck yeah, don't mind me, I'm just hanging out over here. I'll stay fixed no matter what, cause I'm stick'n with the viewport... even when you scroll this thing</div>
</br>
  <h2>4. Absolute</h2>
  <div class ="mom"> 
    <h2>I am mother</h2>
    Where I go, my child, who is absolutely attached to me, goes with me. I happen to be positioned relative to my normal position.
    
    <div class="absolute"><h3>Absolute child</h3>Eh hem, yeah I'm kinda like Fixed, but he never goes anywhere. For me? I prefer mom, I'll go anywhere she goes. I am absolutely attached to my mommy.</div>
