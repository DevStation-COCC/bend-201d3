# Problem Domain:

The Bend Puppy Rescue has tons of pups who need good homes. One of the best ways to reach prospective adoptive homes is to have profiles for each puppy available on a website. There are hundreds of puppies, though, and only a few volunteers; it's too time-consuming to hand-code each puppy's profile on their website. They need a better way.

## what would you like to have as features?
### required features
- Have a website to feature existing puppies
- We already have puppy pics, so will need to display picture, breed, age, good with kids/dogs/cats.
- Eventually, I would go there, create a puppy profile by typing in the puppy's name, age and create a narrative of who the puppy is, including personality, likes, etc...
- breed
- good with kids/dogs/other cats
- picture(s) - one at minimum, more is nice

 ### nice to have
- what their story is
- notes from the foster human
- health history
- videos
- animated gif
- social media links - linkedIn profile
- blink tag

 ## user scenario
 Jake is a volunteer for Bend Puppy Rescue. He has some level of comfort with a browser and copying/pasting/saving/uploading/etc. He navigates to the enter a puppy form and enters the above info in a form box. When he clicks the "submit" button, the puppy's profile is displayed on the page.

### out of scope
   Removing puppies from the site,
   videos, health history, foster notes, social media, blink tag, as well as abilit to upload new puppy photos.

## user stories
1. As a volunteer for Bend Puppy Rescue, I want to have puppy bios show up on the page without having to write html myself, so that my workload is lessened. I will know this is done when I can hard-code a puppy bio in JavaScript and that puppy's bio is rendered on the page.

2. As a volunteer, I want to enter the puppy's data into a form, and have that puppy's specific profile automatically show up on the page, so that my workload is lessened. I will know this is done when I can enter puppy data into a form, and that puppy's bio shows up on the page

3. As the web services manager for Bend Puppy Rescue, I want the code for the bio generation to be written in plain-vanilla JavaScript, so that it can be easily maintained. I will know this is done when I can look at a JavaScript file for the site, and see it written in ES5, with no use of libraries or frameworks.
