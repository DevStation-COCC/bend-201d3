# Class 16: Project Week, Day 1

This is probably the busiest day of project week. The morning is occupied with students getting their projects up and running. Be sure to read the "Project Requirements" doc CAREFULLY; it is in Class 15 so you know what the students are expected to prepare and produce for the initialization of their projects.

**Reminder**: You should schedule another round of one-on-one meetings this week.

In addition, you will be leading your students through their first standup meetings. Here are some recommendations on how to do that:

### Initial, shorter standup at the beginning of each day (Project Manager role)
- Make each student stand up
- Close laptop lids!
- 30 seconds per person to check in: what did you do previously, what do you plan to do next, is anything blocking you from moving forward?
- As a team, what is the goal by the end of the day?
- Tell them you will circle back with each group for a Technical Review later in the day
- Tell them you will circle back for a very brief, end-of-day check-in to make sure each group is okay and there are no major blocking issues

### Technical Review (Technical Lead role)
- Begin with a demonstration of the application in its current state
- Dive into their code base
- Ask the group to evaluate their percentage of completion, then adjust it based on observations from reviewing the code base
- Make yourself available every other day or so to allow groups to block off time and tackle larger issues one-on-one with the instructor

### Notes:
- Makes grading final projects easier
- Lets students know that you are available throughout the day
- Review individual daily project reports before standups so the instructor is aware of any issues and where the group is at
- Deploy on Day 1
- Define milestones based on MVP: when should they hit MVP? What should that include at the bare minimum
- Maybe establish for students some targets for CSS?
