# Class 2: Basics of HTML, CSS & JS

### Announcements:
 - Quizzes:
 	- Note that there will be some quiz content from time to time that we may not have covered yet (for instance, something on the quiz published today that we will not cover until the next class).
 	- Keep in mind that you have unlimited re-takes on the quizzes, and also that the quizzes are designed to be treated like they are open-book. It's more about what you can figure out than what you have memorized.
	- Also, note that the quizzes have two main purposes:
      1. To get you to re-engage with the content in a different way, reinforcing your knowledge.
      2. To help you prepare for the Code 301 entrance exam, which you will take at the end of Week 3. There is a minimum threshold you must pass on that exam (80%), and also, that exam factors into your grade in this class.

- **Lab 05c** will be published at the end of class. It is a tutorial on working with CSS selectors, and will be due at the time the other Lab 05 assignments are due. It is being published early to give you flexibility and extra time to complete these tutorials.

- Learning journals: Starting today, there is a daily Learning Journal assignment in Canvas. The purpose of this assignment is to reflect on what you have learned today. These assignments are due before the following class.

- There will be lots of detail work today on JS and CSS. We're going forward with the expectation that you will need minimal instruction on HTML except for concepts and overview of practices, and the specifics of how to interface with JS and CSS.

- **Be sure to raise questions** about any topics that you'd like clarity about. If it is a topic that we will cover in the future, we'll let you know and maybe give a quick answer for now. On this day in particular, when we have so much to cover, it is important to avoid going down time-consuming rabbit-holes.

### Learning Objectives

As a result of completing Lecture 2 of Code 201, students will:

- Demonstrate understanding of the fundamental structures of HTML, including `<DOCTYPE>`, `<head>`, `<title>`, `<body>`, and `<script>`, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and a quiz administered in Canvas
- Demonstrate understanding of and make use of assorted data types such as booleans, strings, integers, floats in JavaScript, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and a quiz administered in Canvas
- Demonstrate understanding of and make use of introductory CSS concepts and techniques from Chapter 10 of the textbook, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and a quiz administered in Canvas
- Be able to successfully manage a code project in the command line by doing pushes and pulls to/from a repository on GitHub.

### Git command basics:

- `git status`
   - Provides a detailed description of current state in working directory

- `git add <file/s>`
   - Move one or more files from your working directory into staged status

- `git commit -m "Your commit message"`
   - Snapshot the staged changes in current working directory, with a brief message describing the changes

- `git push <destination> <branch>`
   - Push local commits to GitHub
## Live code

In our code demo today we'll do the following:

- Create a GitHub repo for our weekly project and `git clone` it
- Read through the lab assignment, translate it into a to-do list, and fulfill some technical components such as:
  1. Create a basic scaffold for a code project
  2. Utilize `if/else` statements to handle conditional logic
  3. Add in some basic input validation
  4. Utilize good Git processes including **a-c-p** cycles
